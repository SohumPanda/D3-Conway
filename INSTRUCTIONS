Instructions for running LIFE_FINAL.forth with Life_Display_Squares_Sohum.f graphical display file in SwiftForth 

Drag LIFE_FINAL into SwiftForth. The grid of life will be of size 100 x 100. To change this type the new dimension size and then the word new_dimension and hit enter.
" 200 new_dimension " will update all arrays to 200x200 with 0's . 

Then you can import a structure into life_array_2 using one of the words from the import_structure routine. It is best to put these structures in the middle of the grid at 
[x,y] of [50,50] or [48,48] for example, so they have the space to evolve fully. 

Then drag in Life_Display_Squares_Sohum.f file and type ' go ' into the console and hit enter to see the simulation graphically displayed by purple squares on a dark grey grid.
Fullscreen the display window when it opens up to see the patterns evolving.

When we were running life, line 768 in LIFE_FINAL was uncommented and we created a csv file to save our measurements from each run of life. 

The data saved in each column from left to right is 
Generation Number, Alive Cells in Generation, Number of Cells Born, Number of Cells Died, Static Equilibrium Check, Dynamic Equilibrium Period 2 Check
